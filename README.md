# IPAssess_IoT_Devices

## The novel IPAssess model is a cutting-edge approach in IoT device identification utilizing fingerprinting techniques based on the correlation between device characteristics and network protocols.

## This research extends the application of the IPAssess model by testing its effectiveness across various datasets, differing in scale, device types, and network environments. This comparative study aims to validate the versatility and robustness of the IPAssess model

## This repo includes the IPAssess analysis on three datasets - IoT Privacy Lab, IoT Sentinel and CIC IoT datasets.

#### 1) pcap_to_csv file includes the code to extract the features from the pcap files

#### 2) Classification of Individual packets file includes the code to train and test the classification models using Random Forest and decision forest based on the features obtained from the files.
